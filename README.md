Module 3 Challenge -

Creating a portofolio page using Bootstrap tools to build with.

I have decided to start from scratch with this project rather than build off my old portfolio base.

The page has sections as follows:

- Home/Jumbotron page introducing me and what I do.
- About page giving some background info on myself as well as a profile image.
- Portfolio section presenting and offering links to my work across 3 seperate sectors.
- Contact info section w/ footer.

Enjoy!
